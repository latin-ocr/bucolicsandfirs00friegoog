, viii PREFACE.

The Dictionary is designed to be a complete exhibition of
Vergilian usages of words. It has been prepared with very
great care and labor, and 'yet I sear it will be found very sar
short of the perfection I would have desired. Trusting‚ how-
ever, it may be, at least, the basis of something more entirely
satisfactory, I venture to give it into the printer’s hands,
Whatever value it may possess is, of course, largely due to the
Vergilian dictionarieS‚ keJS‚ and vocabularies hitherto published‚
as well as to the general dictionaries from Forcellini to the
HarperS. My own labor has consisted in examining the text to
ascertain the best interpretatione and definitions of wordS, and
to furnish the Dictionary with the references necessary to illus-
trate and verify the meanings given. One feature of the work,
which 1 find in none before, is a complete representation of
all the proper and personal names found in the text. For this
I am indebted chiefly to the list appended to the smaller edi-
tion of Ribbeck.
