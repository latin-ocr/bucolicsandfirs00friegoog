LIFE ΛΝΒ WRITINGS OF VERGIL. xv

Horace are in no danger. The Aeneid is too grand, too beautiful,
too pure, to be despised, neglected, or lost.

It is replete with all the qualities which are essential to a great
work of art. It is great in conception and invention. It is won-
derfully diversified in scenes, incidente, and charactere, while it
never departs from the vital principle of unity.· It is adorned
with the finest diction and imagery of which language is capable.
In discoursing of great achievements and great events, it never
comes short of the grandeur which befits the epic style; in pas-
sages of grief and suffering it takes hold os our sympathies with
all the power of the most affecting tragedy. What a sublime epic
of itself is the account of the sack of Troy! what a tragedy of
passion and fate is presented in the story of Didol Indeed, the
student. will find in the Aeneid many dramatic scenes, many vivid
pictures of life and manners, many lively narratives of adventure,
any one of which would be of itself a poem, and would secure to
its author an enviable fame.

Of the preeminent worth of Vergil's poemS, and of their im-
portance as literary studieS, the most striking proof is presented
in the fact that so many of the classics of modern poetry, in all
cultivated languages, have manifestly been produced under the
moulding and refining influence of this great master of the art.
Dante, who felt al] the power of “ the Mantuan,” ascribes to him
whatever excellence he has himself attained in beauty of style3
and, in the generous avowal of his indebtedness, he utters one os
the noblest eulogies ever bestowed by any poet upon a brother
poet ε

“ Oh degli altri poeti onore e lume,
Vagliami ’l lungo studi0, e'l grande amore,
Che m’ han fatto cercar lo tuo volume,
Tu se’ lo mio maestro 3 10 ωἰσ autore:

Tu se' solo colui, da cu' io tolsi
Lo bello stile, che m’ha fatto onore.'’ θ’

⁴⁶ Dell' Infern0, Canto I, 82.
