Tmz· text here presented, embracing the Bucolics, the Georgics,
and the Aeneid of Vergil, is the result of a careful comparison of
the older editionS‚ especially those of Heyne, Jahn, and For·
biger, with those of Ladewig, Ribbeck, and Conington, more
recently published. In the twenty years since the issue of my
edition of “ The Aeneid, with Explanatory Notes,” important
changes have been made in the orthography of the Vergilian
text. The labors of Bitschl and Brambach have done much
toward establishing a correct and uniform Latin orthography
for schools, and also a characteristic orthography for the texts
of authors belonging to different periods. The improved and
more accurate forms of spelling due to these and other distin-
guished scholars, have been based partly on the authority of the
Roman grammarianS‚ and partly on the critical study of monu-
mental and numismatio inscriptions and the best existing manu-
scripts. In former investigations of this kind too much weight
was given to the manuscripts, none of which probably date
back earlier than the fourth century of our era, while inscrip-
tions contemporary with the best periods of the language, and
presumably representing the orthography of such periodS, were
left more or less out of view.

Giving proper consideration to monuments of this latter
kind, without lesing sight of the prevailing forms of spelling
