ECLOGUE VIII.

Tms Eclogue is entitled in the Medicean Manuscript “ Damonis et
Alphesiboei Certatio,’' and other good manuscripts differ from the Medicean
on y in substituting “certamen,' or “contentio,” for “certatim” In the
texts enerally it has been called “Phaet-macenariam “the Sorceress,'' from
the su ject 01 the second part of the poem.

It consiste of the improviscd verses of two sh herde, Damon and Alphe-
siboeus. Damon ado ts in his own person the ament of some despairmg
lover whose mistress sa, has proved untrue‚ and Alphesiboeus res nds
by recit‘ ‚ also in the rst person, the incantatione and charms em 0 ed

The Eclogue is Amoebaean of the second kind described in the note on
E. 111, 58. Alphesiboeus imitates the song of Damon in the division of the
verses into ten stanzas by the introduc-tion of 8 refra'm.

Vergil has in mind, in the son of Damon the third and eleventh Idyls
of Theocritus, and, in that of Al ‚ffiesiboeuffi tim second of the ldyls. ⁸
