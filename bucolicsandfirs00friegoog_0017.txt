LIFE AN D WRITINGS OF VERGIL. xi

tude found utterance in the beautiful hymn called the fourth
Eclogue, in which he hails the auspicious times just dawning on
the world, and initiated by the consulship of his friend and patron
Pollio in B. o. 40. The sixth Eclogue was composed in the fol-
lowing year, B. 0. 39, in fulfillment of a promise made to Vama*
The eighth was written in the autumn of the same year in honor
of Pollio, who had gained a brilliant victory over the Parthini, a
people of Dalmatia. The two remaining Eclogues, the seventh
and tenth, were probably composed in the two following years.

Though the material of the Bucolica is taken largely from
Theocritus, and to some extent from other Greek poets, yet Ver·
gil has given to most of them something of a national character
by associating this foreign material with circumstances and per-
sonages pertaining to his own time and country. In the first and
. ninth EclogueS, for example, he describes with deep feeling, in
the dialogues of the shepherds, the social miseries attending the
wars of the triumvirate, and in the fourth he dwells with delight
on the anticipated return of peace and blessedness under the reign
of Octavian. In the first, again, he finds, or rather makes for
himself, the opportunity of expressing his grateful love and ad-
miration of the youthful emperor, while in the fifth he commem-
crates, under the name of Daphnis, the greatness and the untimely
death of the deified Caesar. Finally, in the sixth and tenth, in
the midst of myths and fancies derived from his Grecian masters,
he has immortalized the name of his. friend Cornelius Gallus.

The scenery of the Eclogues, as well as the 'manners and cus-
toms of the husbandmen who make up their personnel, are quite
as much Sicilian as Italian. It is unfortunate, too, that Vergil has
given these poems a still more foreign air by the use of Greek in-
stead of Italian names. But this was the taste of the timeS. He
labors, alec, under another disadvantage, as compared with The-
ocritus, in the want of a Latin dialect suitable for shepherds and
herdsmen, or, at least, in not employing one. While the Sicilian
Greek pastoral generally uses a form of speech approximating
closely to the nature of its rustic characters, the language of Ver-
gil's shepherds is too much like that of cultivated society.
