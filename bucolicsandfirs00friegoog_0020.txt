xiv LIFE AND WRITINGS OF VERGIL.

passage 567-588 in the second book.

Thus the Aeneid, like some of the grandest sculptures of
Michael Ange10, was left unfinished, and with some parts, perhaps,
in the rough. But Ι am not sure that our interest is not even
enhanced in the works of both of these great Italian masters by
the very fact that these unfinished parts show us the hand, as it
were, still holding the chisel, and in the act of creation.

There is another fault, tce. Vergil was an imitator. He
gloried in imitation. He borrowed without stint from Homer,
from Apolloniae, from the Greek tragedies, and, in short, he laid
under contribution all the earlier poets both of Greece and of
Rome. Nothing beautiful in them, nothing fitted to his purpose
escaped his search. But he so appropriated to himself, and assimi-
lated to his own modes of thought their ideae, imageS, and forms
of expression, that they come before us in the Aeneid in all the
freshness and individuality of new creatione. The Aeneid stands
nearly in the same relation to all preexisting literature as does the
“Paradise Lost.'' The authors of these two epics are the great-

assumes so much of their individuality that their plagiarism
becomes a beauty and a virtue. They are plagiarists of the
older poets in the same sense that the painter is a plagiarist of
nature. '

But while the Aeneid, through the premature death of the
poet, has been left to us somewhat incomplete, and while it claims
no great degree of originality, but is largely the offspring, not of
Vergil alone, but of the genius of all antiquity, it always has been,
and always will be, justly regarded as the best and noblest os all
the poetic creatione of the Roman mind, and as one of the choicest
productione of all literature. There are fashions in criticism as
well as in other things3 not, indeed, so changeful and transitory as
those of dress, but fashions nevertheless; and of late years some
scholare, even eminent scholare, have fallen into the, habit or
affectation of speaking with some contempt of “the court poets
of the Augustan age.’' This fashion will have its day3 but it can
not set aside the verdict of so many generations past. Vergil and
