LIFE AND WRITINGS OF VERGIL.

Punuus Vnnoums MARo was born at Andes, a village near
Mantua, in the consulship of Pompey and Crassus, B. ο. 70. Ver-
gil‘s father possessed a farm at Andes sufficiently valuable to
place his family in easy circumstances, and to afford him the
means of educating his son under the most eminent teachers then
living in Italy. The education of Vergil appears to have been
commenced at Cremona, from whence, on assuming the manly
gown, in his sixteenth year, he was transferred to the charge of
new teachers at Milan.

physical constitution, led him to choose a life of retirement rather

Romans usually entered upon the stirring scenes of political and
military life, he withdrew from Rome to his native Andes, with
