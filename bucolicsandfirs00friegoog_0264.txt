Having served the temporary purpose for which they were probably in-
tended, though accidentali preserved, they were roperly omitted by most
of the ancient copyists, an written by others on t e margin of the manu-

In translating the lines we may com lete the sense by borrowing from
the exordium the words 2‘ arma eanosspwith which they were originally
connected, thus: ‘⁶ I, that poet who formerly tuned my song with the slen-
der pipe, and (then) comin forth from the wood (i. e. dismissing sylvan
or astoral themes) taught t e neighbonn fields to funin the desire of the
hus andman, however greedy (1. e., ma e his labors fruit-ful through the
teachings of my poems on husbandry)‚ a work (of song) acceptable to the
tillers of the soil: yet now sing the bristling arms of Mars.”

With ego, ‘⁶ sum ” is usually supplied, but Forbiger more correctly makes
cano the predicate.

BOOK FIRST.

The storm at sea, the landing of Aeneas near Carthage, and
his reception at the palace of Dido.

Ilium; who endured many hardships of land and sea and war, until he founded in
Latium the kingdom from which sprung mighty Romess‘ Thus are indicated briefly,
‘⁸ celeriter comprehensa,” the contents of the entire em: Aeneas, obedient to the
rates and to the gods, in his wanderlngs, his trinis, andpgis war of conquest. In “mul-
tum et terris iactatus et alto ” we have the subject of the first six books of the epic
which thus far resembles the Odyssey ς in “multa quoque et bello passus ” that οἶ
the last six books, in which the poet describes wax-like soenes like those of the Iliad.

1. Qui. Relatives and other connectives are osten displaced in poetry,
and sometimes very widely, from their regular· sition. Primus, first, not

mterpreted and that 1n regard to Antenor, v. 2423 for in th1s sense both
Aeneas and Antenor ' st came from Troy to Italy. It seems that the old
chroniclers began wit the legend of Aeneas and Antenor as the first or re-
motest event 1n Roman traditions3 and thus Li opens the national his-
tory: “iam rimum omnium satis constat Aenea tenoreque . . . Achivos
abstinuisse! Forbiger and others, however, take primus venit in the sense
of “ the first who came‚’' because, the say, Antenor did not come to Ital ,
as the word was understood by Verg1 , but to Patavium, which was in t 0
