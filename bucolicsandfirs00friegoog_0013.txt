σοπρανο, and impar and comptu-0, etc„ Ι have uniformly adopted
the latter3 and in other classes, which as a general rule re-
main nnassimilated, as in compounds‘of ad and con with words
beginning with l, I have used the assimilated forms in particu-
lar ποι-(15, as alliqo and colli90, because those are quite uni-
formly given in the manuscriptS‚ though we write adloquor,
adludo, conluceo, conlabor, etc. The orthography of such com·
ponnds seems never to have been settled3 but it is probable that
the actual pronunciation in respect to assimilation and euphonic
accommodation {vas much more systematic than the spelling.

Whatevererrors of judgment in the decision of these ques-
tions, and whatever inconsistencies of orthography, the reader
may detect, I trust will be met with the indulgence which the
present difficulty of determining such problemS, more difficult
now than ever before, seems justly to call for.

The notes on the Aeneid are substantially those of my for-
mer edition. In the interpretatione occasional changes have
been made, several of them suggested by the admirable com-
mentary of Mr. Conington.*

The notes on the Eclogues are less frequent than those on
the Aeneid, especially those relating to grammatical usageS, as
it is assumed that most of the poetic idioms will already have
become familiar by the study of the Aeneid. The text of the ⁵
Georgics has been given at present without noteS‚ as it has
been impossible for the editor, on account of the pressure of
official duties‚ to get them ready, while it seemed desirable that
the text itself should embrace the whole series of Vergil's
greater poems. Ι hope the Dictionary will largely supply the
lack of such noteS.
