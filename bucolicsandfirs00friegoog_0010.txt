iv . PREFACE.

found in the best manuscripts, the critics of whom I have
spoken have laid the foundation of a general scheme of Latin
orthography, which we may reasonably accept as representing
the best period os the language in its external or orthographi-
eal form. This period was the age of Quintilian or the period
extending from Nero to Hadrian—A. n. 54-118. The best re-
sults of these investigatione are embodied in the works of Wil-
helm Brambaoh.* The system which he has proposed has met
with general acceptance, and is likely to impress itself on all
future editions of Latin authors.

In the present text I have in general adopted the spelling
proposed by Brambach3 following, at the same time, his sug-
gestion as to the treatment of those writers of the Augustan
age, such as Livy and Vergil, who are alleged to have had a
,fondness for the old-fashioned forms.† Δ

The most characteristic feature of this archaic spelling is
the form φο in such words as have usually been written with
vu ‚· as volqua, volnus, cervos, volt, vivont, divom, and the like—
forms which occur so frequently in some editions of Vergil that
they give the poet the appearance, as compared with his friend
Horace, of one of the ancients of a century or two earlier.

Other recent or living scholars have pursued a more mod· -
erate course in the treatment of the Vergilian text3 giving it a
little of the archaie eoloring, but not rendering it a complete
likeness of Plautus or Lucilius, Indeed, no two of the crities
os this class can perfectly agree in their results3 for the res-
toration which they have attempted of the actual spelling of
