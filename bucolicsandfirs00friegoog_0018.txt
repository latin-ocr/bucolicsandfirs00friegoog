xii LIFE AND WRITINGS OF VERG1L.

But though liable to such criticismS, the Eclogues are among
the most graceful and beautiful of all idyllic poems, and they pos-
sess a charm which fascinates the reader more and more with
every perusal.

,The Eclogues established the reputation of the poet, and gained
him at once ardent friends and admirere among the most power-
ful and the most cultivated of the Romans, Among these, be-
sides his early and fast friend Pollio, were Octavian, MaecenaS,
VariuS, Horace, and Propertius. These and all other educated
Romans of the day regarded Vergil as already superior in many
respects to any poet who had yet appeared. It was most of all
in the exquisite finish and harmony of his hexameters that heex-
celled all who had preceded him. The hexameter verse had been
first introduced into the Latin language, at the close of the second
Punic war, by the soldier and poet Ennius, But though distin-
guished by originath, strength, and vigor, the poetry of Ennius
was harsh and rugged to a degree which rendered it to the more
cultivated tastes of later generations almost intolerable. Nor by
the poets who succeeded Ennius had any such improvement been
made in the composition of Latin verse as to admit of any com-
parison between them and their Grecian models. It was reserved
for two great poets of Rome, two congenial spiritS, filled with the
most lively admiration of each other, laboring side by side, both -
striving earnestly for the same object—it was reserved for Vergil
and Horace to elevate the national poetry to a character worthy
of Rome, to develop all the resources of their noble language, and
to make it fiow both in heroic and lyric verse with all the grace
and dignity that had hitherto been characteristic of the Greek
alone. “

After the publication of the EclogueS, Vergil appears to have
passed the remainder of his life chiefly at Naples. His feeble
health was probably the occasion of this.

It was here that he composed the GeorgicS, a didactic poem
in four bookS‚ in which he endeavors to recall the Italians to their
primitive but long-neglected pursuit of agriculture. In point of
versification this is the most finished of the works of our poet,
and, indeed, as Addison remarkS, it may be regarded as in this
