x LIFE AND WRITINGS OF VERGIL.

reckoned among his earlier productionS, are ascribed to him on
very insufficient grounds, The Eclogues were began about B. ο.
42,’ at the request of G. Asinius Pollio, who was then acting as
the lieutenant of Antony in Gaul. Pollio was himself distin-
guished as a poet, and not less as a scholar, orator, and historian.
Under his patronage the second, third, and fifth Eclogues had
already been written, when the literary labors and the peaceful

life of the poet were suddenly interrupted. The veteran legions -

os Octavian, on returning from Philippi, and demanding the allot-
ments of land which had been promised them as a reward for
their services in the civil war, were authorized to take possession
of eighteen Italian cities, with the district os country pertaining
to each. The cities thus treated were those which had espoused
the side of Brutus, For this the unhappy occupants of the adja-

city of Mantua. Vergil, whose farm was in this district and was
thus endangered, had recourse at first to Pollio, and for a time
was secure under his protection. But when that commander‚ in

B. c. 41, marched with his troops to the aid of L. Antonius in the ’

Perusian war, Vergil was compelled to seek relief from Octavian
in person, and for this purpose visited Rome. It was the kind
reception given him by the emperor on this occasion which in-
spired the grateful and glowing eulogy contained in the first
Eclogue, written in the summer of B. ο. 41.

After the close of the Perusian war, the Mantuan country was
again disturbed by the demands of the veterans, and our poet in
vain, though at the risk of his life, attempted to maintain his
rights against the centurion Arrius Fleeing again for succor to
Octavian, he was reinstated‚ though not without long and anxious
delay, in the possession of his sarm. During this period of delay
and depressing uncertainty, in the autumn of B. ο. 41, he wrote
the ninth Eclogue, in which he bewails his unhappy lot. But on
obtaining at length the object of his petition, his joy and grati-
