PREFAOE. V

Vergil is largely conjectural. I would, therefore, prefer to
write this class-of words in the form whieh, no doubt, Quin-
‘tilian and his contemporaries used in making new copies of
Vergil, following the spelling which Augustus seems to have
preferred, and giving us everywhere such forms as vulnus, vi-
vus, divum, and volvunt, rather than volnus, vivos, divom, and
volvont ; and my reason would be the same as theim, namely,
that the true aound was nearer u than 0. It waS, perhaps, a
· usage of ο kindred to that in our English neiqhbor, ‹ra-bor, and
the like. But, on the whole, I have felt constrained to defer
to the authority of those who have aoeess to original docu-
ments, and to admit these forms into the text to some limited
extent. I have therefore adopted, at least for the present, the
vo spelling in volqus, volnus, voltus, in volt and voltis of the
verb vola, and in the genitive plural ending vom, as in divom
and Arqivom. But the nominative and accusat-ive endings vos
and vom of the second deelension, the forms quoius and quoi

of the relative pronoun, quom for cum, and the verbal endings
vont and ‘contum for eunt and vantur, and the partieipia] end-
ing volsus for vul-sm, I have not employed. Also, I have used
the ending imus in superlatives, such as mamimus and opti-
mus, and in some ordinals, as‘deoimus, rather than the older
forms optumus, maxumus, and decumus. The ending umus in
such words leads to error in pronunciation3 so much, indeed,
that it was rejected by Caesar, who substituted imus, an inno-
vation generally adopted by subsequent writers In the treat-
ment of these classes of words my text will be found very
nearly like that of Ladewig.*

I ean' not but think that Vergil, in writing such wordS, while
