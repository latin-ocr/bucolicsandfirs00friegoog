arc the theme of the Eclogue. The new-born infant, thus made the subject
of this immortal hymn, was probably Caius Asinius Pollio, son of that Pollio
whose raises our poet never tires of repeating. The birth of a son to such

cially as 1t occurred m the year of the consulshlp of P01110‚ and at a period
when his re utation was at the highest, and when the circumstances of the
times ‘scemcd actually to be openino· a new and happy era.

It is not surprisi that early Christian wnters and many even down to

Horace, composed a year or two earlier, when Horace was as much ‹lepressed

from the revailing strife and anarchy but in fllght far away to the ‘⁴ For-

which Veroi'l now confidently expects to see once more restore to Italy.

This Edogue is written in a spirit something like that which characterizes
the noble hymns of Menalcas aud Mopsus 1n the fifth. Itis the hymn of
adoriug shcpherds. And we can almost fancy them gathering around the
eradle from which fiowers are sprinffing (J’semdeat cunabula flores), and
