BOOK SECOND.

Aeneas recounts to Dido the capture and sack of Troy.

1-249. After a brief introduction, Aeneas enters upon his narrative, which begin·
with the story of the wooden horse. The Greeks, now in the tenth year ot thc si e,
dishenrtened by their ill success, resort to stratagem. On the night which prece es
the burning of the city they pretend to hat-e given over the siege, and to have taken
ship sor their homes; leaving upon the plain, before the walls or Tro ‚ an immense
fabric os wood, made to resemble a horse, and of such βίω that it can carried into
the city only by enlarging the gnte, or breaking down a portion of the wall.

within this fabric are concealed many of the Greciun chiese, while the arm , under
the command of Agamemnon, instead of continuing the voyage, is lurking be ‘nd the
island of Tenedos, a few miles from Troy.

The Trojsn multitude issues from the gates, and, guthering round the strange
image, hesitate whether to convey it into the city, or to destroy it.

At this moment the cunning sinon, who has purposely sufiered himselfto be made
prisoner, is brought before King Prlam, and by his arti'ul story gains the confidence of
the Kin ‚ and leads him and his eople to believe that the wooden horse, once laced
within t e citadel, will become, li'ke the Palladium, the safeguard of Troy. '1 e de·
vice of Slnon and the Greeks is aided by Minerva, who sends two serpents to slay the
