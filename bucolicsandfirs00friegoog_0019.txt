LIFE AN D WRITINGS OF VERGLL. xiii

respect the most perfect of all poems. In the first book he treats
of the management of fields, in the second of trees, in the third
of horses and cattle, and in the fourth ot bees. He has gathered
into this poem all the experience of the ancient Italians on these
subjects, and he has contrived to make them attractive by asso-
ciating them with wonderful beauty of diction and imagery, and
with charming variety os illustration.

Having devoted seven years, from B. c. 37 to the writing of
this work, and consciens that his poetic labors must be ended by
an early death, he now entered upon the long-cherished plan of
composing an Epic in the Homeric style, which should at once
commemorate the glory of Rome and of Augustus, and wiu back
the RomanS, if possible, to the religious virtues of their progeni-

he expired. His death occurred in B. o. 19. His remains were
conveyed from Brundisium to N aples, and buried on the hill of
PosilippO, in the tomb still preserved and revered as the “ tomb
of Vergil.”

It is said that Vergil, a short time before his death, desired to
burn up his Aeneid, in consequence of the imperfect state in
which it would necessarily be left. But being dissuaded from
this purpose by his friends Tucca and Varius, he directed them
in his will to strike out all the verses that were incomplete, but
to add nothing. It does not appear, however, that anything was
erased by them, unless we admit the account of some of the gram-
marians who alleged that Tucca and Varius rejected the four
