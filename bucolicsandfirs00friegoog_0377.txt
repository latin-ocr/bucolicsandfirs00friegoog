779-871. Venus, in her dread of the persistent anger of June, appeals to Neptune
for his inter-position to prevent any further disaster by sea 'to the fieet oi· Aeneas.
Neptune reminds her of 1118 former friendly acts to Aeneas both on sea and land, and
promises now to protect him, requiring‚ however, that one of his crew shall be lost on
the voyage. Meanwhile, the whole ficet proceeds under full 8811, led by the ship of
Aeneas, which is steered by the pilot Palinurus. ln the night Aeneas and allon bom-d
fall asleep‚ except Palinurus, who watches, and keeps the helm alone. Somnus de-
86611118 from the sky, and tempts him to sleep‚ and, 111 spite of his resistance‚ over-pow-
ers him with Lethean influence. Palinurus falls over into the 868, 8ι111 grasping the
belm, and carrying a fragment of the sbip² torn off with it. Aeneas is awakened by
the irregular motion of the ship, and perceiving the fate which 1188 1161811611 Palinurus,
bemoans his loss, while he himself directe the course.
