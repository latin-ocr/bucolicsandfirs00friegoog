ᾗ PREFAGE.

in his love of the old ways he preferred, just as we do in

English, the traditional forms, must have pronounced them 1

precisely in the same manner as did Caesar, AugustuS, and⁴
Horace; that is, with an indefinite sound of u instead of o in
100, and of i instead os u in umus. ⁴

Ribbeck,* in common with other recent critics, has repro-
duced or aimed to reproduce in the orthography of his text
the diversity and inconsistency exhibited in the manuscripts.
For, as the old English writerS, so also the Latin authors and ·
copyistS, were often at variance with themselves in the spelling
of words. But though such exact representations of the varia-
ble and unsettled orthography of the language are of much in-
ter-‚est and importance in critical philology, and in what is called
the pathology of a language, it is obvious that for the general
reader and for school purposes the text should be as uniform
and consistent as possible.

The words which are most variable in the manuscripts are
the compounds of adjectives and verbs with prepositions. The
difficulty of choice here is very great. After much effort in
the direction of some systematic method, 1 have taken, on the
whole, for each class of compoundS, the forms given first by
Brambach‚ where he allows more than one, and where the
authorities are so variable as to make the choice nearly or
quite a matter of indifference3 while I have used the excep·
tional compound forms in individual words which in manu-
scripts and inscriptions are found nearly or absolutely uniform.
Thus in the compounds impar, compaw, and others of the
same class, which in Ribbeck vary somewhat between inpoer,
