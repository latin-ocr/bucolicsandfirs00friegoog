[Nom.—Words and mets, whether Latin or Greek, etymologically related to
the words defined, and also Greek' words identical with the Latin, are placed im-
mediately before the definitione, the former in parentheses.

'Phe parts of compound words are not indicated separately when they appear
unmodissed in the compound form, nor when prepositions in composition are
modifled only according to the general rules mentioned under the definitione of

prepositions.

In verbs, only the principal parts are given which are understood to be in actual
use3 and generally one of the numerals, 1, 2, 3, 4, designates the conjugatiom and
therefore the form of the infinitivo.

References to the Eclogues and Georgics are indicated respectively by the let-
ters E. and G. ς numerals without letters refer to the Aeneid.

'I'he characters Ι, i, are substituted both in the text and dictionary for J, j.
Therefore‚ for δα, 010, Ju, ja, je, Ji, jo, ju, at the beginning and in the middle
of words, see Ia, Io, Iu, ia, ie, ss, io, iu, in the proper alphabetical orden]
